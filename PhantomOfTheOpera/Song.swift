(Christine)
In sleep he sang to me. In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me. And speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

(Phantom)
Sing once again with me. Our strange duet
My power over you. Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me. To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

(Christine)
Those who have seen your face. Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

(Phantom)
It's me they hear

(Both)
Your/my spirit and my voice in one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

(Phantom)
In all your fantasy. You always knew
That man and mystery

(Christine)
Were both in you

(Both)
And in this labyrinth. Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is here / there

(Christine)
Inside my mind

(Phantom)
Sing! My angel of music

(Christine)
He's there
The phantom of the opera
Ah...........

(Phantom)
Sing, sing for me
Sing, my angel of music!
Sing for me!

(Christine)
Ah..........!!!!!

(Phantom)
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
Music......
You have come here
For one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing
For my music...
My music...

         lyrics: """
Think of me,
think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that once agian,
you long to take you heart back and be free .....
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me ...

We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea -
but if you can still remember,
stop and think of me ...
Think of all the things we've shared and seen
don't think about the way things might have been ...

Think of me
think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me,
trying too hard to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do -
there will never be a day
when I won't think of you ...

Can it be?
can it be Christine?

Bravo!

Long ago,
It seems so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me,
But I remember her ...

Flowers fade, The fruits of summer fade,
They have their seasons so do we.
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think...
Of me!

(Raoul)
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

(Christine)
Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summer time
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

(Raoul)
Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

(Christine)
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

(Raoul)
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you

(Christine)
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you

(Both)
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

(Christine)
Say you love me

(Raoul)
You know I do

(Both)
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me, that's all I ask of you
